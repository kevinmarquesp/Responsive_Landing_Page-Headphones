# Responsive Landing Page ðŸŽ§

I started this project just for study *patterns* for structuring a project and make a beaty code, and to make animations when the page is scrolling down. Moreover, I wanted to adapt some *CSS* project to *SCSS*, and I tryed to organize the files to make the whole project more easy to read and understand.

At the beggining, it was meant to be just a silly project to learn some of the basis of web development, but I managed to fix some bugs and improve the interface in some points. Therefore, don't find weird if my *commits* ended up being in the same *branch* ðŸ˜… (Usualy, I do't make stuffs like that).

Of course, I wouldn't just copy someone else's code and say I evolved without make some changesâ€¦ ðŸ’ª

## What I learned in this little adventure

1. Finally, I did can use my CSS grid layout study in practise, and even learned some new tricks with that...

2. I learned a different navbar style that I'm not used to use, and I learned how to highlight some text when the page is in a specific position.

3. I found an *JavaScript* library (**Scroll Reveal**) that is more easy to use an make animations when the page is scrolling.

4. I learned to create the "back to top" button (it was more easier than I thought).

5. OGANIZED CODE HELP TO FIND BUGS.
